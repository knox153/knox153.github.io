Hi, my name is Chee Yew Lim or Jonathan. Currently a student at University of British Columbia exploring the unknown. 
I am *probably* obsessed with technology, terrible at basketball, and in love with delicious food. I also enjoy listening to all kinds of EDM and play video games like it is my life. 
I created this website to document all my projects and share it with the world. Feel free to let me know if any of the contents on this website helped you, would love to hear about it :)
