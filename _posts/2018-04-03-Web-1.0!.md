Hurray! Creating a personal website has always been on my to-do list, and I have finally done it. It reminded me of how satisfying it is to create something I enjoy.
Anyway, I will be using this website to document all of my future projects, and occasionally write about tech-related stuff.
I thought of making a tutorial on how to create a website like this, but there are already plenty of tutorials out there so I will just link a few of them below.
 
Tutorials:  
[Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages][tutorial-3]
[Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub][tutorial-1]  
[Building a Portfolio with Jekyll][tutorial-2]  


Moving forward, I am excited to see what I will be able to achieve with this website. Awesome contents are coming soon!  

To-do list for this website:

1. ~~Add Google Analytic~~    4/4/2018
2. ~~Create and add Favicon~~    5/4/2018
3. ~~Make misc. on portfolio accordion/collapsible~~    6/4/2018
4. Modify 404 page
5. Make custom SVG for portfolio
6. *Maybe* change the theme?
7. Add dark mode
8. Make it more mobile friendly
9. Make sure site run properly without JavaScript
